# ANN_project_implementation

## Problem Statement
- Implement an ANN to predict whether a customer will exit/leave the bank or not.

## Pre-requisite
- We have a dataset 'Churn_Modelling.csv' in the form of a csv file, containing data about whether a customer will leave the bank or not.
- The dataset consists of 10,000 record along with 14 features, one of them being the 'Outcome' column.
- Install libraries mentioned in 'requirements.txt' using command `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Run commands
- The application can be executed/run using command `python -m streamlit run app.py`
- The app can also be deployed using 'Streamlit' in-built deploying facility.
